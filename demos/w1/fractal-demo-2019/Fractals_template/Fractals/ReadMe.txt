Note!
This template is for CSIS0271 course students only.

Please find 12 files and 3 folders in the package:
	Code.cpp			source file for fractals computation
	Code.h				header file
	Fractals.cpp	source file for the interface
	Fractals.h		header file
	Fractals.ico	program icon
	Fractals.rc		resource template
	Fractals.sln	Visual Studio Solution file
	Fractals.suo	Visual Studio Solution User Options file
	Fractals.vcproj	project file
	Readme.txt		this file
	resource.h,resrc1.h	resource header files
	\ColorMaps	color map files
	\Samples		sample .mfr and .jfr files
	\bin		executable file Fractals.exe

Please use Microsoft Visual .NET 2005 to open the
template. Use File->Open Solution... in MS .NET 2005 to open the
Fractals.sln file.

Add your code in the functions Mandelbrot() and Julia() in the
Code.cpp file. Although no modification to the other files is
necessary for you to fulfill the requirements, you are allowed
to do whatever change to the above files as you like.

You can import bmp files as color maps. The program will take
the first 256 pixels' colors as the color map. You can create
your own color map using any image retouching tools such as Adobe
Photoshop and Corel Photopaint. Just make sure that the bmp files
must have width >= 256 pixels.

You can save you fractals in files (.mfr for mandelbrot set) and
(.jfr for julia set). Please fill feel to exchange with your
coursemates. The fractals files are in fact text files. You can
directly edit them if you like.

Please email fractals files (.mfr/.jfr) and color maps (.bmp/.rgb)
of good looking fractals to c0271@cs.hku.hk. Pretty ones will
be posted on the course homepage.

Enjoy!
